      <h3>Why Us?</h3>
      <p>We want to help your business! UX research is usually only used for large corporations. We're
        on a mission to bring these research methods to the
        most important part to our economy, the small and medium business. </p>

        <h3>What Do We Do?  </h3>
        <p> We come to your business, and use user research
          methods to help you gather data on your users and consumers. We then help you to find data on who
          your target audience is, and how to make their experience better with your
          business, product, service, or website</p>
        </div>
        <div class="boxContainer">
          <h3> Whats The Purpose?</h3>
          <p>Our goal is to conduct research to help you understand who
            your customer or users are. We created this company becasue large
            companies found this out, but we want to help the small and medium
            companies to use these same methods so you can grow as well.
